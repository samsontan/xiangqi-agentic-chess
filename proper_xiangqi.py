    Create a complete Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) game in Python with authentic rules. Requirements:

    BOARD SETUP:
    - 10x9 board (10 ranks, 9 files)
    - Palace: 3x3 area at each end for General and Advisors
    - River: divides board between ranks 5 and 6

    PIECES (with proper Chinese names and movement):
    1. General (Â∏•/Â∞á): Moves 1 point within palace, cannot face opponent's general
    2. Advisor (‰ªï/Â£´): Moves diagonally 1 point within palace
    3. Elephant (Áõ∏/Ë±°): Moves 2 points diagonally, cannot cross river, cannot jump
    4. Horse (È¶¨): Moves like chess knight but can be blocked
    5. Chariot (Ëªä): Moves like chess rook
    6. Cannon (ÁÇÆ): Moves like rook but must jump to capture
    7. Soldier (ÂÖµ/Âçí): Moves forward, sideways only after crossing river

    IMPLEMENTATION:
    - Text-based interface with clear Unicode symbols
    - Coordinate system: a1-i10 (files a-i, ranks 1-10)
    - Input validation and move legality checking
    - Basic AI using minimax (depth 3) with position evaluation
    - Game state management (turn, check, checkmate)

    Make it a single, complete, immediately playable Python file.
    Use proper Chinese chess symbols and include move examples in the interface.
